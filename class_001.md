Welcome to the rodeo, your job this semester is just to stay on the bucking bronco, and not worry to much about how you manage to achieve this goal!


# Class Notes:
1. There are no labs(i.e. they are not manditory).
2. Simply logging into the platform for live sessions will earn 1/2 of your participation grade.  The rest will come from actual participation in the class.
3. Homework for 1 is due before the start of Live Session 2.
4. It's not too early to start thinking about topic for final project.(https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php)
5. This class starts slow then builds in speed.
6. You are strongly encouraged to collaborate on homework, but please make note of it on your submission.
7. __Office hours are the primary opportunity for Homework Discussion__
8. Homework 1-4 is reasonable effort.
9. Homework 5-7 are very hard.
10. Homework 8-9, are back to reasonable.
11. Homework 10 is optional if you include two machine learning algorithms in final project.
12. Our grading approach anticipates many of you feeling overwhelmed.
13. Weeks 3-5 many of you will reach out to me concerned you are falling behind.

# Importance
Cake:  __Book__, Async, Homework, slack, group
Iceing:  _Live sessions_

Slack will be the central space you turn to make sense of the harder parts of this class.  It is the fastest way to connect with me and get support from your other students.

# Exam
21 question
60 min
all open answer
password give out in class 7 and you have 1 week to take the exam

# Class Structure
Class 1: Orientation
Class 2: Lab(group work)
Class 3: Machine Learning on Iris
Class 4: Review homework 1-3
Class 5: Free
Class 6: Mini-exam prep/ML Wine(prep for final)
Class 7: Prepare for Exam
Class 8: Free
Class 9: Work in teams on final project
Class 10: Present final projects


# Me
#### Education
  - English BA -> Computer Science PhD (i.e. long road)
#### Work
  - Jump starting teams and groups(Ecolabs, Argonne, Triggr Health, Data Science for Social Good.)
### What role I will take
  - Coach/enabler >> disciplinarian


# You
### What role you will need to take
  - patient, diligent, self starting
  - learn a new communication style
  - learn a new way of signaling you involvment in a community

### Different roles
- Async and Book are most important for homworks and quizs
- Live sesions are most valuable for final presentation
- Directly after live session is best time for going over homework/remedial help
- Office hours provide over flow for that time
- Slack provides opportunity for collaboration between students

# Why this perspective is important:
- Data Science == Programming, Statistics, Math,  Domain Specialist, Business specialist
- Programming == Data engineer, code optimizer, Object Oriented coder, Scientific Programming
- Statistics == Bayesian, Frequentist, Statistical Machine Learning
- Math == Numerical Linear Algebra, Wavelets, Signal processing


With so many ways to contribute, itâ€™s hard to figure out how to be you versus how to be someone else.


# Crucial resources:

If you are just getting started with R.  Install r studio and install the swirl package.

http://swirlstats.com/students.html
We will use:  install_from_swirl("R Programming")
We will complete the first 15 assignments over the first 4 weeks.


If you are a SE(sofware engineer) and the above was too simple,  the link below explains how R works under the hood.

#### Disclaimer:  I have dysgraphia. It's a kind of visual blindness for symbols.  What this means: Get on github and fix my typos.  Starting in markdown and moving to Latex at somepoint.



Notes:
If you learn a bunch and develop your skills you will definitely get a good grade regardless of what path it takes to get there.
