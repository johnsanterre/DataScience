# Intro:

#### Education
  - English BA -> Computer Science PhD (i.e. long road)
#### Work
  - Jump starting teams and groups(Ecolabs, Argonne, Triggr Health, Data Science for Social Good.)
### What role I will take
  - Coach/enabler >> disciplinarian

### What role you will need to take
  - Patient, diligent, self starting

# Why this perspective is important:
- Data Science == Programming, Statistics, Math, Domain Specialist, Business specialist
- Programing == Data Engineer, Code Optimizer, Object-Oriented Coder, Scientific Programming
- Statistics == Bayesian, Frequentist, Statistical Machine Learning
- Math == Numerical Linear Algebra, Wavelets, Signal processing



With so many ways to contribute, itâ€™s hard to figure out how to be you versus how to be someone else.  




Class Notes:
1. There are no labs (i.e. they are not manditory).
2. Simply logging into the platform for live sessions will earn 1/2 of your participation grade. The rest will come from actual participation in the class.
3. Homework for 1 is due before the start of Live Session 2. 
4. All late homework gets a .5 out of 3 deduction.  
5. It's not too early to start thinking about topic for final project. (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php)
6. This class starts slow then builds in speed.  
7. You are strongly encouraged to collaborate on homeowork, but please make note of it on your submission.  


Crucial resources:

If you are just getting started with R. Install r studio and install the swirl package.  

http://swirlstats.com/students.html
We will use: install_from_swirl("R Programming")
We will complete the first 15 assignments over the first 4 weeks.  


If you are a SE (sofware engineer) and the above was too simple, the link below explians how R works under the hood.

#### Disclaimer:  I have dysgraphia. It's a kind of visual blindness for symbols.  What this means: Get on github and fix my typos.  Starting in markdown and moving to Latex at somepoint.



Notes:
If you learn a bunch and develop your skills you will definitely get a good grade regardless of what path it takes to get there.

Opportunities for every day work:
Links to HN etc
Add more in why important section
memorization sheets for anki?
move this to the overview of this file?
